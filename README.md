# Anomaly Destroyer - Game Jam Plan

## ðŸŽ® Game Concept
You play as a defender of Earth who must destroy **Anomaly Zones** (crystals) that spawn endless monsters.  
The player can also create their own anomaly powers to fight back.  
Destroy all anomaly crystals to win the game!  

Itâ€™s a **top-down arena shooter** with powerups, enemies, and a win/lose condition.
